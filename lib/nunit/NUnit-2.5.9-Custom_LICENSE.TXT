This is a custom build of NUnit, based on the v2.5.9 source code.

NUnit uses the Fit library, which is licensed under the GNU GPL.  Our interpretation of the terms of the GPL is that this means NUnit should also be licensed under the GPL, however the author of NUnit disagrees and chooses to license it under the more permissive license below.

In order to avoid a potential GPL license violation, we have built this custom version of NUnit that is exactly the same as v2.5.9 except with all references to Fit removed.

This version is released under the same license as the original:

License Note

This license is based on the open source zlib/libpng license. The idea was to keep the license as simple as possible to encourage use of NUnit in free and commercial applications and libraries, but to keep the source code together and to give credit to the NUnit contributors for their efforts. While this license allows shipping NUnit in source and binary form, if shipping a NUnit variant is the sole purpose of your product, please let us know.
